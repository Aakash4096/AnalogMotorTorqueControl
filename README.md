##Part 0:
Downloading application such as KiCAD for designing ,simulation and PCB development for the whole project
##Part 1

Started learning by watching how other deployed and operated the whole schematics and designing
From youtube :- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kDMF0SQ0Zg&list=PLJ0HErIq5D2zQIZq9s4L3cUzeMuB7d4Ho&index=2
