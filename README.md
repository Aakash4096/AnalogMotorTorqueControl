# Zine Project
## Stage 0:
Downloading application such as KiCAD for designing ,simulation and PCB development for the whole project
## Stage 1 – Circuit Design

### Power Stage – H-Bridge Design(Idea From Other's Project)

Purpose:

The H-Bridge is a power control circuit that lets current flow through a motor in both directions, so the motor can rotate clockwise or anticlockwise.
It also helps control speed and torque when used with PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals.


Started learning by watching how other deployed and operated the whole schematics and designing
From youtube :- https://www.youtube.com/watch?  v=4kDMF0SQ0Zg&list=PLJ0HErIq5D2zQIZq9s4L3cUzeMuB7d4Ho&index=2.   

Thus finally implemented it on my own.
